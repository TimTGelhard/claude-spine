## [Unreleased]

Active roadmap in [`LAUNCH.md`](LAUNCH.md):

- **L5** — clean-room install on a fresh VM/container (pre-launch validation gate)
- **L7** — domain, landing page, demo video, waitlist (public launch)
- **L8** — opt-in: personal migration off a standalone `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-27

First tagged release. Pre-launch state — architecture frozen, personalization loop shipped, self-tests passing. Awaiting clean-room install verification (L5) and public launch (L7).

### Added

#### v2 architecture

- **75 atomic chapter files** under `chapters/<topic>/`, one concept per file (~150-line ceiling, real-seam decomposition). Index at [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md); inverse map at [`V1-CHAPTERS-DEPRECATED.md`](V1-CHAPTERS-DEPRECATED.md).
- **18 core skills** in `skills/core/op-*/` — pure routers from task intent to the right atomic file(s). None hold chapter content; the bodies are 34–60 lines each.
- **5 personalization chapters** (`chapters/personalization/19a`–`19e`) — net-new in v2.

#### Personalization loop

- `op-onboard` — first-run interview, writes `~/.claude/claude-spine-profile.md` (5 essentials + opt-in `/onboard --deep` for the full set). Re-runnable via `/onboard` or `/onboard --deep`.
- `op-suggest` + `/suggest` — capture friction during normal sessions to `bucket/SUGGESTIONS.md`. Locked four-condition trigger (explicit user signal, 2+ repeat friction, end-of-session reflection, explicit command).
- `op-curate` + `/curate` + `/curate --review-stale` — review pending suggestions, apply or reject, with hard refusals on `chapters/`, `skills/core/`, profile, and global stub.

#### Personal skill library ("the bucket")

- `bucket/` ships empty by design. Each user builds their own library.
- `op-add-skill` + `/add-skill` — gated skill-creation (3+-paste-in rule from [`13d-skill-anti-patterns.md`](chapters/persistence/13d-skill-anti-patterns.md)).
- `op-bucket-router` — fallback router. Reads `bucket/INDEX.md` (auto-maintained) only when no core skill matched.
- `/refresh-bucket` — rebuilds `bucket/INDEX.md` from disk; preserves `Added` dates.

#### Installer + global

- `install.sh` — self-locating, idempotent, backs up overwritten files to `~/.claude-backup-<ts>/`. Symlinks `~/.claude/skills/op-*` → `<spine>/skills/core/op-*` so `git pull` propagates instantly. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--opinionated`, `--keep-legacy`, `--skip-{global,skills,commands,settings,hook}`. macOS + Linux; Windows redirected to WSL.
- `uninstall.sh` — removes spine-owned symlinks only. Leaves `CLAUDE.md`, `claude-spine-profile.md`, `bucket/`, and `settings.json` in place.
- `global/neutral/CLAUDE.md.template` — thin stub (default install).
- `global/opinionated/CLAUDE.md.template` — founder-flavored example (`./install.sh --opinionated`).
- `global/settings.json` — `effortLevel: "high"`, `autoCompactWindow: 180000`, opinionated `permissions.allow` (TS / Next.js / Supabase / Vercel — trim to fit your stack).
- `global/hooks/block-env-staging.sh` — denies `git add .env*` patterns via the PreToolUse hook protocol.

#### Tests + CI

- `tests/hooks/test-block-env-staging.sh` — 12-case fixture (6 should-block, 6 should-allow).
- `tests/installer/test-dry-run.sh` — 48-assertion sweep across 7 install scenarios (default, `--opinionated`, legacy cleanup, `--keep-legacy`, every `--skip-*`, `--help`, unknown-flag rejection). Isolates `HOME` to a temp dir.
- `tests/skill-triggers/` — skill-description benchmark harness using the `skill-creator` plugin. Documented bias toward under-counting routing-skill TP; reliable for FP regression detection.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — runs the fast suites (hook + installer) on push to `main` and on pull requests.

#### Documentation

- `README.md` — public-facing entry point (install → first session → architecture).
- `INDEX.md` — atomic-file router map (topic → file).
- `V1-CHAPTERS-DEPRECATED.md` — inverse map (v1 chapter → v2 atomic files).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — single-maintainer policy, what's welcome / unlikely, commit style.
- `EXPLAINER.md` — long-form architecture for skeptics.
- `RECONSTRUCTION.md` — v2 build history (Phases 0–8e), frozen architectural decisions.
- `PERSONALIZATION.md` — personalization loop design (Phase 8).
- `LAUNCH.md` — gap-fixing roadmap from v2 to public launch.
- 9 project-doc templates under `templates/` (project CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT_BRIEF.md, SMOKE_TESTS.md, DEPLOY.md, SESSION_STARTER.md).

### Changed

- 18 root-level v1 chapter files (`01-first-principles.md` through `18-anti-patterns.md`) now carry a one-line deprecation header pointing at the v2 location. Body content preserved for external-link compatibility; new work should read the v2 atomic files in `chapters/`.
- The four legacy `op-manual-*` skills (`op-manual-workflow`, `op-manual-tactics`, `op-manual-templates`, `op-manual-recovery`) are superseded by the 18 `op-*` skills. `install.sh` removes the legacy directories from `~/.claude/skills/` and backs them up; `--keep-legacy` opts out.
- `global/settings.json` defaults — `effortLevel` `"xhigh"` → `"high"` and `autoCompactWindow` `800000` → `180000`. The Pro-burning defaults were never the right floor; Max-plan users opt up via the new "Tuning for Max 20x / 1M context" section in `global/INSTALL.md`.
- 14 skill descriptions previously referenced "Claude Code Operator's Manual" (the pre-v2 project name) → swept to `claude-spine`. Cross-references in `op-anti-patterns`, `op-subagents`, `op-persistence`, `op-signaling` to the old `op-manual-*` skill names → swept to current names (or to direct template-folder pointers in the `op-persistence` case).
- `chapters/anti-patterns/18f-security.md` rewritten to be self-contained — no longer references "your global CLAUDE.md" for the forbidden list. `chapters/foundations/04c-budget-and-cost.md` now points at 18f directly. A neutral-stub installer no longer hits a dead reference.

### Fixed

- `global/hooks/block-env-staging.sh` — regex boundary for the leading path prefix was `(\./)?` but the hook's documented patterns included `git add foo/.env.local`. Widened to `(.*/)?` so any leading path is matched. Surfaced by the new hook fixture; covered by 6 should-block + 6 should-allow assertions.

### Decided (no code change)

- **No skill-sharing platform.** The bucket is each user's personal toolbox. There is no curated examples folder, no GitHub topic convention, no Discussions. Rationale in [`README.md`](README.md) and [`bucket/README.md`](bucket/README.md); the speculative-library trap argument lives in [`13d-skill-anti-patterns.md`](chapters/persistence/13d-skill-anti-patterns.md). Revisitable if real user volume produces sustained pressure.
